        Report::String.new(<<~MSG)
          The following suggestion runs compaction at boot time, which reduces fragmentation inside of the Ruby heap. This can improve performance and reduce memory usage in forking web servers.

          Before forking your web server, run the following Ruby code:

            3.times { GC.start }
            GC.compact

          For example, with Puma, which runs its before fork hook once on boot (before the initial fork), add the following code into config/puma.rb:

            before_fork do
              3.times { GC.start }
              GC.compact
            end

          With Unicorn, which runs its before fork hook before each fork, add the following code into config/unicorn.rb:

            compacted = false
            before_fork do
              # avoid invalidating heap pages shared with previously forked children
              unless compacted
                3.times { GC.start }
                GC.compact
                compacted = true
              end
            end
        MSG
      end

    end
  end
